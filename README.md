# Bomb Lab and Assembly
Project 3 in CSCI 2021 (UMN) completed Fall 2021. Focus on Assembly and the famous "Bomb Lab."

## Part 1
The first part of this project found in the bitwise folder is translating the code I wrote in the previous project (Project 2) into Assembly in order to still perform the same bit shifts.

**I edited ONLY bits.s**

## Part 2 
This is the famous Bomb Lab that many are familiar with. More information on this lab can be found at:

**I used GDB for most of this, added input.txt to defuse all 6 phases**
